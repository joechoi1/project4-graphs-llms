If there's bad weather on a siren test day and the sirens go off, check NWS or a similar site for severe weather warnings before assuming it's just the test.\n",

They rely on students being naive and moving out-of-town, accepting reduced deposits or forfeiting entire deposit amounts. Unfortunately, the owners of these companies donate heavily to local politicians, and the local city councils in both Champaign and Urbana allow them to continue these practices. The University has a hands-off policy as well, since this is all done by LLC companies, not publicly accountable agencies. The OP's plan to organize a class action lawsuit is a great idea, but local attorneys MIGHT be difficult to find to help out, because again...they are allied with local real estate interests. Consulting with UIUC's student legal services might be the key to change, but I hope the Illinois Attorney General's office gets involved: they have the power to sanction and fine these companies, and take legal action if necessary.

The counseling center’s purpose is to help students, but they can only accommodate a small amount of long term clients due to the size of the student body and the limited amount of counselors they have. They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options. People expect a team of about 20 counselors to be a catch-all solution to the entire breadth of potential mental health issues of 50,000 students, but really they are a crisis management/referral service. If you are keeping all that in mind I think it’s worth trying out.

Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we’re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. \n",

I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn’t matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I’ve seen over time, I wouldn’t trade the effort I’ve put into either of them for the world.\n",

I joined WECE specifically to meet my fellow women in ece because there were so few of us😢I don’t think there’s anything wrong with WECE being more social focused - from what I saw, that’s why many people joined, so it makes sense to have a focus on social events. My takeaway from WECE is having a community to lean on in a male dominated major/industry, which is very important post college.\n",

I personally find agricultural land beautiful but that is due to my heritage. But I have backpacked in a variety of mountains and environs which I also find beautiful. It is not mutually exclusive. In general it is best to not say to prospective neighbors, \"I’ve heard there is no natural scenery down there.\" People in this group have chosen to live here for a short or long while and have found the quality of life OK. If you've seen a sunset on the prairie, a meandering prairie river lined with trees, a country estate with formal gardens and woodland trails punctuated with statuary, a dome of stars going on forever, or an orange harvest moon rising over fields of corn in the fall and find those to be pedestrian then yes we have no natural scenery.  ;-)\n",

We went to a nearby ATM and before I gave her the money she wrote me a check. Little did I know, that you could verify if a check is valid or if the amount on the check would bounce just by calling the customer service number on the back of the check. I accepted the check and went on the train home. I knew in my gut something was wrong and that the check was fake, but I decided to ignore my gut feeling because I really wanted to help her out and even if I was getting scammed, I was fine with losing the $300, because I was going to make a lot more the next morning because I had a hobby that was paying well at the time. When I got home, tried to verify the check , but it was invalid. It turns out the check was that of a deceased person in Indiana and that the account has been closed. I still have the check to remind me to trust my gut and not always my head\n",

(Not that it's easy now, but it's not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\n",

Usually easiest way to get there would be to leave w/ Amtrak @6am/10am and from Union u can take blue line or Metra to rosemont. Going back to campus might be a little more difficult. I think you would need to leave next day. For BETS in 2022 they ended the show almost at 11 and most transportation back to campus isn’t available that late. I think last Amtrak train back to campus leaves at 10pm. Easiest option to avoid going from Rosemont to Chicago to uiuc would be to take Peoria charter. They make a stop @ O’Hare which is really close to Allstate and drop offs are at Illinois terminal, ISR, and Armory. Or if you don’t mind going back to the city then take the early Amtrak train @ 6/9am. Also,  before I forget Amtrak has student discounts (15% off??).\n",

They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options.

Within each time period, the books are arranged by author's last name. If you go to the actual library and find a map with all the locations of the Library of Congress numbers, you can usually find the vast array of shelves that have books you'd want to read. It's still going to be challenging because works of scholarship and analysis are mixed in with the fiction (e.g., you'll find all the books written ABOUT Toni Morrison and her novels alongside Sula, Beloved, Song of Solomon, etc.), but once you figure the pattern out, it gets easier to skim the shelves.\n",

Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we’re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. \n",

      "I will also say as a final note that I can’t speak for your individual experience on this (or WECE as an org), but in terms of discourse or drama, the grass is not always greener on the other side. I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn’t matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I’ve seen over time, I wouldn’t trade the effort I’ve put into either of them for the world.\n",

But there needs to be a contractual agreement that the institution will only fund those 5 things. The 6th, providing weapons to Israel, will be unacceptable. I understand that in this day and age, it is difficult to completely divest from corporations that supply other countries, regardless of if you agree with their policies or not.

That’s the point here: UIUC is super supportive, and most people are incredibly nice. There are numerous activities aiming to help you fit into the community. It’s fine to be shy. I’m pretty sure there are lots of shy people, and most of them end up having life long friends in UIUC. You got this!\n",

      "Error processing text: I had quite bad social anxiety as a teen and struggled to make friends most of my life, being a total loner until I was 20. (Not that it's easy now, but it's not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\n",

One of the main risks is that underground pipelines used during the pumping process could rupture and release CO2 into groundwater supplies, which would change the water chemistry and release toxic minerals such as mercury into the water.\n",

Usually easiest way to get there would be to leave w/ Amtrak @6am/10am and from Union u can take blue line or Metra to rosemont. Going back to campus might be a little more difficult. I think you would need to leave next day. For BETS in 2022 they ended the show almost at 11 and most transportation back to campus isn’t available that late. I think last Amtrak train back to campus leaves at 10pm. Easiest option to avoid going from Rosemont to Chicago to uiuc would be to take Peoria charter. They make a stop @ O’Hare which is really close to Allstate and drop offs are at Illinois terminal, ISR, and Armory. Or if you don’t mind going back to the city then take the early Amtrak train @ 6/9am. Also,  before I forget Amtrak has student discounts (15% off??).\n",
